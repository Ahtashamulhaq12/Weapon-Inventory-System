📦 Secure Weaponry Sales & Inventory Management System

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Semester Project

📌 Project Overview

The Secure Weaponry Sales & Inventory Management System is a console-based application developed using C++ and core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The system is designed to manage weapon inventory, ensure legal and secure sales, and maintain accurate records of weapons and customers.

This project demonstrates how OOP concepts can be applied to build a real-world, security-sensitive system in a structured and maintainable way.

🎯 Objectives

Automate weapon inventory management

Enforce secure and controlled weapon sales

Apply OOP principles in a practical scenario

Reduce manual errors in record keeping

Generate proper sales receipts for customers

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation – Protects sensitive data using access specifiers

Inheritance – Different weapon types derived from a base class

Polymorphism – Runtime method overriding for weapon pricing and display

Abstraction – Abstract base class for common weapon behavior

Virtual Functions & Destructor – Ensures proper runtime binding and memory handling

⚙️ System Features

🔐 Login System (Admin / Authorized User)

🗃️ Weapon Inventory Management

🧾 Weapon Sale Processing

🧮 Automatic Price Calculation

🧾 Customer Receipt Generation

💾 File Handling for data persistence

❌ Restricted Access for unauthorized operations

🧩 System Structure

Base Class: Weapon

Derived Classes:

CivilianWeapon

MilitaryWeapon

Core Functionalities:

Add weapon

Display inventory

Sell weapon

Generate receipt

Save & load data from files

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

File Handling: fstream

Platform: Console Application

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone or download the repository

Open the .cpp file in any C++ compiler (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.)

Compile and run the program

Follow on-screen instructions

📁 File Handling

Weapon and sales data are stored using file handling

Ensures data is preserved even after program termination

🎓 Academic Purpose

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course to demonstrate:

Practical use of OOP concepts

Clean and modular code design

Real-world system modeling
